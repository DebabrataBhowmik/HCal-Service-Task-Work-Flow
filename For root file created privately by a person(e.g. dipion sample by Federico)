Go to work directory(cd ../../../work/d/dbhowmik/public)
make a directory and name accordingly.(e.g. mkdir myIsotrack/)
Walk into the directory (cd myIsotrack)
Now you need to create a CMSSW area by cmsrel(generally the latest although unstable version of CMSSW). To do this you need to run the following commands.

export SCRAM_ARCH=slc6_amd64_gcc530
scram list 

These two lines will provide you the list of all CMSSW versions(latest) available.
Now,

cmsrel CMSSW-version (e.g. cmsrel CMSSW_9_0_X_2017-02-24-2300)
cd CMSSW_9_0_X_2017-02-24-2300/src
cmsenv
git cmd-merge-topic 17605

Then add the code of the analyzer(i.e. copy the directory called "Callibration" from previous workspace) and do

scram b -j 4

Now, enter /Calibration/HcalAlCaRecoProducers/test
